# Dex-Crawler

## What it is?

It is a simple web crawler tool which takes initial urls(Url Seed), crawls all the pages 
of the same domain and finds outs the dead-links and stale-links across the website.

## How to run?

## Use-case :

While using the documentation SDK Tools at https://developer.amazon.com, developers often
end up at dead-links. These dead-links are links which might point towards repositories which 
might have been moved somewhere else. Therefore, Dex-Crawler stores all those links so that 
they can be removed.
